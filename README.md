## Get started

### 1. Install dependencies

```
npm i
```

### 2. Set up formatting with Prettier and ESLint

If you are contributing to this repo, you must make sure ALL your code is formatted
according to our `eslint.config.mjs` and `.prettierrc.json` configs. The best way to make
sure you are always sticking to our guidelines is by having prettier & eslint
automatically format your code when you save.

Here's how to set that up:

- If you are using VSCode, do the following:

  1. Install the
     [Prettier ESLint VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rvest.vs-code-prettier-eslint)
  2. Install the
     [ESLint VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
  3. **Restart VSCode completely (quit app and reopen).**

- If you are NOT using VSCode, either use VSCode or you'll have to figure out how to
  format-on-save on your own.

### 3. Run the app in development mode

```
npm start
```

## Additional scripts

Launch the test runner in interactive watch mode:

```
npm test
```

Create an optimized production build:

```
npm run build
```

## Credits

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to handle code
formatting.
